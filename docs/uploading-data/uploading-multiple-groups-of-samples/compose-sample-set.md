# Compose Sample Set

### Patient

If the samples are of a patient whose card is already in the account, then you need to select this patient from the drop-down list. If there is no patient, create a new one by selecting the appropriate field in the drop-down list.

### Sequencing type

The most efficient CNV discovery is for whole genome sequencing (WGS), but if you have targeted sequencing (exome or panel), select the appropriate category from the drop-down list. If you are not sure what type of data you have, choose WGS.
