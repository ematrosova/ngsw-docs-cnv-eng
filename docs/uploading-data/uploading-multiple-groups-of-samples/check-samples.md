# Check Samples

If you have verified that all samples have been added according to the patient and you want to run the analysis, click on **“Submit Samples”**.
Now it's up to Genomenal, data processing is fully automated, you just have to wait for the results. The processing time depends on the analysis type and the size of your files and ranges from 30 minutes for a targeted panel to several hours for a WGS sample.
In the meantime, the algorithm is working, you can view the results for previously processed data, fill out a patient card or do other work. When the files are uploaded, you can safely close the tab, browser or log out of your account - the analysis will continue in any case.
